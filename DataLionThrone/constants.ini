max_stat=20
; How much AS is needed to double
speed_to_double=4
; What a mounted units CON is subtracted from to determine AID
mounted_aid=15
; 0 - No critting, 1 - 2x damage minus 1x defense, 2 - 3x damage minus 3x defense (normal)
crit=0
; How many movement points does a normal tile cost to traverse
normal_movement=1
; Which column flying units should use in mcost.txt (0-indexed)

; Which column units with fleet_of_foot should use in mcost.txt (0-indexed)
fleet_mcost_column=7
; Number of levels in game
num_levels=12
; How linear the exp curve is. Higher = less linear (normal FE is around 1)
exp_curve=0.22
; Higher the number, the more exp gotten for each interaction overall (normal FE is around 10)
exp_magnitude=11.7
; Normal exp is multiplied by this on a kill (normal FE is 3.0)

; Whether units on defense can double their attackers
def_double=0
; Whether this game has supports
support=0
; What the max level before promotion is (normal FE is 20)
max_level=10
; How to level up non-player units
; 0: Random - On level-up, growth rate chance to level the stat.
; 1: Fixed - Start each stat at 50. On level-up, add growth rate to stat. When over 100, decrement by 100 and level the stat once
; 2: Hybrid - On level-up, sum all growth rates together. Choose x of the stats to level-up randomly based on their probability, where x summed growth rates/100
; 3: Match - Match whatever the player chose
enemy_leveling=3
; How to level up player units
; 0: Fixed, 1: Random, 2: Hybrid, 3: Allow choice
growths=3
; How hits are calculated
; classic - one d100 is rolled. If > hit rate, miss. (FE 1 - 5)
; true_hit - two d100 are rolled and averaged. If > hit rate, miss (FE 6 - 13)
; true_hit+ - three d100 are rolled and averaged. If > hit rate, miss
; no_rng - Set a threshold. All attacks with <= hit rate, miss. If you use this, additional "set_roll=49" required in this file
; hybrid - All attacks hit. Multiply damage by hit rate.
rng=true_hit

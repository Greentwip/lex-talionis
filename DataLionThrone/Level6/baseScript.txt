	s;Theo;It was raining.{w}{br}Hard, drumming, pounding rain.{w}{br}The kind of rain you'd hope would clean the filth right off the streets.{w}{br}Sam "Snake Eyes" Alhara was waiting outside the station.{w}{br}Well, not all our wishes can come true.{w};auto;noir
	u;Sam;Right
	s;Sam;What is it Theo?{w}{br}I'm kind of busy here...{w}{br}Our next raid is quite important.{w};auto
	s;Theo;Sam was a cool customer, with a face made for radio.{w}{br}An old partner of mine, but we'd drifted apart since I left the force.{w}{br}Too bad he was my only lead on this one.{w};auto;noir
	s;Sam;Prim's missing tome?{w}{br}Really, Theo?{w}{br}Don't you think this could wait?{w};auto
	s;Theo;I could tell he was hiding something.{w}{br}Sam's the kind of guy who'd jump at the chance to prove himself to the force.{w}{br}Kissing the commissioner's ass was half his job description these days.{w};auto;noir
	s;Sam;Well, maybe the Empire's managed to infiltrate us after all?{w}{br}This isn't good...{w};auto
	s;Theo;Please. Don't make me laugh. {w};auto
	s;Theo;You'd have figured Sam would've had some smarts,{w}{br}since he surely hadn't graduated the academy on his looks.{w};auto;noir 
	s;Theo;This is not the way the Empire would've done it.{w}{br}It was somebody on the inside, Sam!{w};auto
	s;Sam;But, who would've taken Prim's tome...{w}{br}Did you talk to Renae?{w}{br}Or you could try Nia, she's perceptive, if you can get her to talk.{w}{br}Anyway, I've got work to do...{w};auto
	r;Sam
	s;Theo;Clearly, Sam was not going to be any more help.{w}{br}He didn't know a thing--{w}{br}no surprise.{w}{br}After I roughed him up a bit, he made like a rat on a sinking ship and bailed.{w}{br}But I had one more lead, and I was going to make it count.{w};auto;noir

	s;Renae;Not so fast there, stranger!
	s;Drake;Huh? Miss, are you addressing me?
	s;Renae;You bet! Mister red-haired stranger man--
	s;Drake;The name's Drake.
	s;Renae;Right. Blake--
	s;Drake;Drake.
	s;Renae;You can't come in unless you know the password. 
	s;Drake;Password? 
	s;Renae;This is the Resistance base, y'know, and we can't have just anybody walk in!{w}{br}That's why Sam entrusted me with guarding the entrance!
	s;Drake;But... I don't know the password.
	s;Renae;Then, Hank, you're out of luck!{w}{br}Come back another day!
	s;Drake;I swear on my knightly honor that I am a full-fledged member of the Resistance.
	s;Renae;You sure about that, Nate?{w}{br}'Cause I think I would recognize a member of the Resistance.
	s;Drake;It's Drake, and also I'm quite sure.{w}{br}Don't you remember when we attacked Fort Kosheen?{w}{br}I held off those guards.
	s;Renae;Hmm... Nothing's coming to me.
	s;Drake;I was also present when we disrupted that Imperial weapon shipment.
	s;Renae;You're wasting my time, Frank.{w}{br}I think I would remember some tough looking red-haired dude, don't you?{w}{br}You're not exactly easy to miss.
	s;Drake;Urgh! I don't have the patience for this.{w}{br}Just... go retrieve Sam or Althea!{w}{br}They'll vouch for me.
	s;Renae;Woah, now.{w}{br}Don't get all bent out of shape, Drew.{w}{br}I finally figured it all out!
	s;Drake;Really?
	s;Renae;Yep! You're Althea's boyfriend!
	s;Drake;What! No!
	s;Renae;Now you're just confusing me, Mike.{w}{br}Are you Althea's boyfriend or not?
	s;Drake;No. Yes. I mean... Urgh!{w}{br}I am Althea's pledged guardian!{w}{br}But we're not in a romantic relationship!
	s;Renae;So, its more of a friends with benefits thing? I like it!
	s;Drake;Urgh!!!{w}{br}Please. No more, Renae.{w}{br}I can't handle it. Just let me in.
	s;Renae;Heehee! I'm just pulling your leg, Pate.{w};auto
	s;Drake;What? This was all a practical joke?
	s;Renae;Yep!{w}{br}Like Sam would ever assign ME guard duty!{w}{br}He'd have to be out of his mind!{w}{br}Hahaha! Ciao!

	s;Kayla;Tsk Tsk. Don't you worry, Sam.{w}{br}I'll be ready.{w}{br}Here, sit down with me.{w}{br}Maybe you can help me decipher this tome?

	s;Sam;...
	s;Kayla;Take a look at this pattern.{w}{br}This symbol shows up all over the place.
	s;Sam;Hmmm... Maybe its the key?{w}{br}It shows up on page two, three, five, seven, eleven...{w}{br}...{w}{br}Primes!

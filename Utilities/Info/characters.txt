Example Scene (Outro of Prologue)
A: Eerie. Bandits this far into Mercia.
S: Ah, don't be so down, Aelfred! They were nothing we couldn't handle! 
C: Don't jest -- Aelfred speaks truly. Why would bandits be ranging this far from the foothills? 
A: Whatever the reason, I'm not standing here to find out. We've got to make the monastery at Ren's Brooke before nightfall.
C: Aye. Nettle is probably waiting for us at the bridge. Let's catch up.
S: What's the rush, Ced?. You got something special planned for tonight? Involving a certain special someone?
C: Huh? No... Anyway, it's none of your business either way. Let's go.
Cedric leaves.
S: Hah, he was blushing beet red. ??

Story Idea 3

Themes: 
Earthier and Grungier than most... Low-magic setting
It has knights and heroes...
However the world does seem to be slowly dying. It's getting worse and worse. People are getting sick. There's reports of monsters in the far reaches. Crops don't grow as well. People are dying in their 30s.
So when a Lorian shows up, claiming he can fix this... well maybe some listen.
Locke calls their land Thanatia, the Land of the Dead. The Isle of the Damned.
Main countries:
Athria - Southern land of beaches and forests, famous for its libraries. Has the best tacticians
Mercia - Middle land of hills and mountains -- a land of warriors, yet often plagued by bandits from the West
Umbria - Northern land of swamps, marshes, and coves -- a land of thieves and spies. Athria and Mercia lost diplomatic contact with Umbria many years ago.
Loria - A mystical land across the water. Lorians conquered this land a nearly 600 years ago, but left unexpectedly in the past 200 years. Famous for its mages and wyverns, which were brought to Thanatia.

Only Dark and Light Magic, which are effective versus one another and uneffective versus the same
Dark Magic does debuffs, AOE attacks, and weird effects (like summons, warping). Less Accurate more damage spells.
Light Magic does healing, buffs, and single target long range damage. More accurate, less damage spells.

Main protagonist's internal conflict is about death. Throughout the first 2/3rds, he always tries to find a way to keep everyone alive -- using and abusing the Waif's power to return his comrades to life. But, he eventually realizes that this is not good. He has been furthering the destruction of the natural balance and increasing the Rot. He comes to accept that death must be accepted on its own -- which is in opposition to Locke's psychological need to defeat death at any cost -- even if the life granted is not worth living

Environment vision is pre-medieval to medieval Britain. Green meadows, rolling hills, ancient forests -- but contrasted by the Rot... dead land, Lorian ruins.
Colors greens and browns, small yellow, blue for background. Gray, black, dark brown, white, red, purple for rot.

Character vision
Clothing should be scrappy, ragged, even for lords. The world is dying -- we're just living in it.

In which they think they have succeeded, but its actually a trap, and Prot, Dark, and Slate are killed.
There's actually 2 rituals (3 kings for unsealing gate). And The Waif bangs on the door.
It was sealed long ago by the blood of three kings, and can only be opened the same way. I'd rather it be the living blood. No, there must be a good reason for it to be sealed. They didn't know what they were dealing with. I do. I can release the gate. The dead can come back.
No, it doesn't work. They tried in Umbria. She came back, but she wasn't the same...
The waif is captured, and told to knock on the gate, but she refuses.
He orders them killed
Now, girl, shudder, if you want them back. She shudders and the gates swing open. 
They are resurrected, their souls not having left the earthly plane
The gate is opened and Locke's wife comes out. But she's not right. Bert. Others start pouring out of the gate, and they have to seal it back up by spilling the blood of three kings. Or destroy the gate for good. The dead and the living cannot linger, the world is now slowly dying. Locke is killed, and he and his wife disintegrate. The Rot continues, so they have to finish fast. (22)
Any of your dead units also respawn.

- Need to consider what intrigue happens to prepare the reader for Umbrian superweapon.

- 3 years ago: Athelwulf exiles his firstborn son, Adelbert. Why?
- 2 years ago: Lywark destroys/removes the first seal of Loria. The world starts getting much worse -- plagues, sicknesses, crops don't grow as well.
- 6 months ago: Adelbert meets Lywark in the ruins of Loria. Lywark has been studying the ancient artifacts and believes they are the key to bringing his beloved back. Lywark convinces Adelbert he can raise him to his rightful throne. Actually, he wants the seals to unlock the Gate of the Damned.
- 4 months ago: Umbrian Queen begins experimenting with dark magic.
- 1 month ago: Adelbert and Lywark kill Athelwulf. Lywark convinces Adelbert that he can conquer the other 2 kingdoms. Really, Lywark just wants the Seals.

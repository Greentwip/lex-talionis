## Small major update finalizing some changes I've been wanting to make for a while

Like usual, old saves don't work when you transition to this update

Major Things added:

## New Advanced Status Components

New status components to make skill design easier and more customizable, enabling cool things like Combat Arts, Proc Skills, and custom unit actions.

Check them out here: **TODO link**

## Other updates

1. {unit2} in dialogs should be more useful. {unit2} has been added to the death_quote_info.txt as the unit's killer.
2. Added ability to merge items together in the "Transfer" menu
3. Repair shop added as a new event tile
4. Arena added as a new event tile. More info here: **TODO ARENA INFO**
5. feat_list master status no longer required. Now just label any statuses you want to use as feats with the "feat" component.
6. Dragonstone animations (FE8 formatting) should now be convertable by the fegba2lt_animation.exe converted found **TODO**. Make sure there is a Dragonstone.txt, Transform.txt, and Revert.txt script in the initial directory.
7. Legendary animation now available. Place the component "combat_effect" on an item and then this attribute `<combat_effect>Legend</combat_effect>`
8. Summoning should work again. Check out how its done in the status.xml/item.xml included with the Lion Throne
9. Added Silver Card capability

## Minor Bug Fixes/Features
1. Nosferatu and other lifelink items now only heal up to damage dealt.
2. Enemy battle music should now be able to be changed
3. Using a controller should be less likely to crash the game when its an unexpected type of controller.
4. Integer damage on upkeep with "upkeep_damage" component
5. Items can now define the battle music with "battle_music" component
6. Map Sprites can now use 0-9 for gender instead of M and F if you so wish.

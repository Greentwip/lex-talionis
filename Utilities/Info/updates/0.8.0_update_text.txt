Level Editor and Tutorial

Yes, it's finally here folks. The fruit of nearly nine months of labor -- my baby, the Level Editor for the Lex Talionis Engine.

There is a tutorial which explains how to use the Level Editor here: https://github.com/rainlash/lex-talionis/wiki.

You will not need to know how to code AT ALL to use this tutorial, in fact we will never touch the codebase. Just follow the directions and you'll be well on your way in no time. The tutorial should guide you through everything you need to learn to get your first level set-up and running. I welcome questions, so feel free to PM me!

Some people have already started using it for their projects -- I know of two projects in the works myself, and with the Level Editor and Tutorial's official release, I hope to hear of more.



Writing and testing the Level Editor and Tutorial took up the bulk of my time these past months, but there have been a few more changes. 

Custom Combat Animations

Two New Difficulties

Lunatic Mode:

Have you ever wanted to distinguish yourself from among the horde of casuals who dare to consider themselves Fire Emblem players? Have you ever wanted to lose -- a lot? Over and over and over again? Well have I got the mode for you!

Lunatic mode (like other Fire Emblem hard modes before it) drastically ups the difficulty. But your own characters bring better stats and new weapons to the fight as well. And trust me, you're going to need it. I only managed to beat it on Lunatic Casual, but I'm sure someone is hardcore enough to try besting Lunatic Classic.

Grandmaster Mode:

Hate missing? Despise the RNG? Want to truly prove your LTC skills? Welcome to Grandmaster mode, where only the greatest tacticians will triumph. Instead of missing an attack, the attack will instead do damage modified by its hit chance. So a 50% 10 damage attack will always do 5 damage in this mode, instead of flipping a coin for 0 or 10 damage.

Minor Changes:

Over 100 minor changes to the Lex Talionis Engine, generally to make creating your own custom levels easier.
Spoiler
Gameplay Balancing

Slight nerf to Halberdier promotion gains (Eliza has been buffed slightly to make up for this)
Halberdier loses access to Axes
General gains access to Axes
Chapter 6 has been made slightly easier
Sandblast ​​​​​​'s number of uses lowered from 10 to 5
End-game adamant weapons have been buffed (-2 weight, +10 accuracy)
Casual mode now allows you to make a Battle Save at any time

A few caveats before you venture forth:

Bugs: As always, I am only one man and cannot find every bug in this behemoth of a codebase (and its only gotten bigger!). So if you encounter a bug, please send me a PM or comment here with the full error message. Also attach your Saves/debug.log.1 if you can, since it has useful information that will help me find the bug and squash it.
Saves: Since I made some changes to streamline the level creation process, the format of the save files changed once again. You will not be able to use your old version 0.7 save files in this version.  There's nothing groundbreaking in this update for the base game, so if you're still playing The Lion Throne's Hard mode, just keep going. You can upgrade to this version layer if you want to try out anything new.
What's Next?

I'm sorry to say, but this is my last content update for The Lion Throne. I've accomplished everything I set out to do with this project. I'll still be around handling any bug fixes, but there will be no more core gameplay updates.

But fret not -- I  will still be working on improving the Lex Talionis Engine. I hope that you will see another project by me in the future. I've been mulling over something spicy, and I hope to be able to present it to you all when it's ready.

Thanks to everyone who played it. I hope you enjoyed playing The Lion Throne as much as I enjoyed making it. And I hope others find the engine useful to them in their own pursuits.

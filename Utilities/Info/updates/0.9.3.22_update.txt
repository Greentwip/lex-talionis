Hello everyone!

Let's try doing an update announcement. v0.9.3.22 of the Lex Talionis Engine is now released. 

It adds support for accessing the Arena from the base. The Wiki here: https://gitlab.com/rainlash/lex-talionis/-/wikis/100.-Miscellaneous-Stuff#arena-global-constants explains how to do the thing. The capability itself should work correctly, but it doesn't look perfect, since combat still does a fade in/fade out on location even from base. 

Other bugs/features:
Fixed issue when stealing with 0 exp
Added gender locked items <gender_locked>5,6,7,8,9</gender_locked>
Added class locked items  <class_locked>Myrmidon,Swordmaster</class_locked>
Added tag locked items <tag_locked>Armor</tag_locked>
Added tags as legal weapon levels <LVL>Armor,Drake,General</LVL>
Fixed help dialog crash if the description was too long
Fixed issue with Ruin Ward animation missing
Added "inherit_class_skills" game constant. By default, it is True. When turned off, units will lose their previous non-feat class skills on promotion.

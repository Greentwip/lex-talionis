# 0.9.4.3 update

# Bug Fixes
Fixed game crash when auto_promote is not available and a stat boosting item is used

Fixed issue where turnwheeling an Angelic Robe use caused the unit to lose that amount of HP below their original maximum

Fixed Level Editor crash on clicking a unit on the map before selecting a unit in the Unit Menu

Fixed AI group issue where not all members of an AI group would go

AI now uses view range instead of MOV + 2 to determine if it should bother using beneficial status spells

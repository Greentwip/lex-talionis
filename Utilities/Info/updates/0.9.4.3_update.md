# 0.9.4.3 update

# Features
Title Screen event script now available. If _Data/titleScript.txt_ exists, will load and play script immediately upon booting the game.

Units capable of stealing will show a green exclamation point over enemies' heads if they have a stealable item. Thanks ZessDynamite!

If map is greater in size than 58 x 38 tiles, minimap will now be scrollable so no portion of it extends off the screen.

Items can now have a `cooldown` component, which prevents the item from being used for a number of turns after USES run out instead of breaking completely.

`t` transitions for event scripts now have more options. See the wiki for more information.

Fatigue is now available! With a side serving of options! Check out the wiki here:

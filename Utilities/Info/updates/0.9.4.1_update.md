# 0.9.4.1 Updates

Bug Fixes:
Fixed bug with saving a c_uses item with 0 uses left
Change Portrait ID now uses Turnwheel
C_uses component now works better when all used up
Fixed bugs when total HP decreased during map combat
Fixed missing display when brave on attack
Fixed display bug with over 80 hp in combat animations

Features:
Item component <use_custom_anim> can now take a name to use instead of always using the item id
<exp_multiplier> status component now available (could use this to create Paragon skill, for instance)
autopromote and level max changes (New "auto_promote" tag to force auto promote even if its otherwise turned off)
Status Components:
"lost_on_endchapter" removes status at the end of the chapter
<gain_status_after_kill> gives a status whenever the unit kills another unit
<gain_status_after_attack> gives a status whenever the unit attacks (on player phase)
<gain_status_after_active_kill> gives a status whenever the unit attacks and kills a unit (on player phase)
Added new event command "activate_turnwheel" and "activate_turnwheel;force" which starts the turnwheel when the dialogue script ends. You can use this to implement Three Houses style turnwheel plot armor (check out how its done in the most recent update to the Lion Throne). "activate_turnwheel;force" forces the player to move the turnwheel at least one turn back.

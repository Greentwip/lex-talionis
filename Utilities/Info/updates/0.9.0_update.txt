As prophesied, **Version 0.9.0** is out now.

## The Turnwheel Update

[[Turnwheel Gif]]

So yeah this update took forever. It required a massive overhaul of the Engine. Any possible action the player can take during a turn had to be rewritten to make sure it could be reversed on command. And because of this, I had to do a lot of testing for this update. As I am only one person, and so much of the Engine changed, there are probably still some new and improved bugs lurking about.

# Turnwheel Info 

In **The Lion Throne**, I have set it up so that each level completed will grant the player one additional turnwheel use.

## Supports

The Engine now has support for supports.

[[Support Image1]]

You can set up your supports to work like the GBA games where supports are gained in combat, or like Path of Radiance, where you choose who to support with whom in base.

Other feature additions:



Added more customization options for combat equations. Removed some of the customization options in `Data/constants.ini` (These have been moved to the new file `Data/equations.txt`)
Added more constants that control how weapon experience is gained.
Added a minimum damage constant to set minimum damage that can be dealt.
Different classes can now gain experience at different rates (Added class exp multiplier)
Units with Steal can now gain exp when stealing (set constant "steal_exp")
Added support for multiple player parties in Engine (see https://gitlab.com/rainlash/lex-talionis/wikis/29.-Multiple-Parties)
Can now change phase music with the event command `change_music` (like `change_music;player;Distant Roads`). Can now clear music stack with `music_clear`
Can now change what statuses count as feats
Can now change what stats Rescue will halve. In fact, rescue status can now be any status effect, as long as it's ID is "Rescue"
Added `cannot_be_crit` status component. While held, unit cannot be crit.
Added `no_choice` flag to event command "give_item". Use this in base conversations
Lethal hit on a boss can now be forced to show a critical animation even if you otherwise wouldn't have crit
Can now set items to use custom animations (like Durandal for Roy...)
Items can now have range of MAG/2
Can scale boss growths and boss bases by difficulty mode
Statuses can now apply attackspeed bonuses and penalties
Can now set up battle music
And probably a lot more that I've since forgotten.

Like usual with big update changes, you will not be able to use old saves with this version of the Engine.

Other important notes for those using this Engine:

The newest version of the FEGBA2LT_animation_converter should handle everything but Mages, Sages, Dancers, and Manaketes.

I also wrote a new utility that converts map sprites from GBA format to Lex Talionis format.

If you'd rather start your game from the normal Fire Emblem base, I now have a bundle of data files that I created for the Sacred Stones in the Lex Talionis Engine.

You can find these download links for these utilities and packages here: https://gitlab.com/rainlash/lex-talionis/wikis/101.-Utilities

Can now automatically generate autotiles within the Level Editor.

Data files that need to be updated if you move to this version:
items.xml (Skeleton Key)
status.xml (Rescue, Feat List)
equations.xml
constants.ini
difficulty_modes.xml
words.txt
If you want supports:
affinity.txt
support_edges.txt
support_nodes.txt

There have also been Audio/sfx updates thanks to BBHood217.

Other bug/minor fixes:

Unit portraits are now correctly rendered when ID and Name are different.
Units with Canto can no longer Rescue/Drop chain infinitely.
Xbox controllers work again.
Player controlled healers now prioritize lowest HP unit in range when starting selection.
Victory screen now displays correct values.
Unit tags and class tags now split.
Disintegrate now correctly does half damage on miss.

Next Update:

v0.9.1 will be a small feature update
- Fix music fade in/out -- rewrite music thread (loops, battle music, sections of music)
- Add multiple 0-4, 5-9 map sprites for each class
- Add separate combine action to convoy
- Add support to fe_repo_to_lex for Dragonstone units and Mages/Sages

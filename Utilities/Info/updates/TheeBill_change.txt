Feel free to delete this file once the web tutorial is updated. I hope this is a fine place to put this.
Anyways this is how the choice event command works now:

old: choice;title;header;options

example: choice;SaveEmmeryn;Try to save Emmeryn?;Yes,No,Smash

new: choice;title;header;options;arrangement

example: choice;SaveEmmeryn;Try to save Emmeryn?;Yes,No,Smash;v

arrangement: can be either horizontal or vertical. Determines how choices are displayed. 

arrangement accepts h or horizontal for horizontal layout and v or vertical for vertical layout. 
If nothing is typed for arrangement, it'll just be treated as horizontal 
(this will save people using the old choice command from running into issues or having
 to tediously convert)

Code changes were done to the following files:
- GeneralStates.py
- Dialogue.py
- MenuFunctions.py

Mode list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Animations have 12 modes that need to be completed for the animation data to be complete.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part 1: Normal attack
	Layered in front of the enemy
Part 2: Called with normal attack - mimicks sound effects and uses blank frames to keep the timing
	Layered behind the enemy
Part 3: Critical attack
	Layered in front of the enemy
Part 4: See mode 2; this is for critical attacks, however
	Layered behind the enemy
Part 5: Magic attack
Part 6: Critical magic attack
Part 7: Close range dodge
Part 8: Ranged dodge
Part 9: Standing "animation"
	Can have more than one frame - they actually play, too!
	Must have at LEAST one frame, or the game will crash, though
	These get to play about the first 16 frames of the animation before they are interrupted
Part 10: Standing "animation" 2
	Should be same as previous (could probably get more creative though)
Part 11: Ranged standing "animation"
	Can be the same as the previous two standing animations
Part 12: Dodged attack

Mode requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are descriptions of the format of the different modes; items marked by "*" are required;
items named "frames" are optional animation frames. Terminators are implicitly required.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normal and critical attacks:
03*, 07*, standing frame, frames, 04*, 1A for normal hit/08 for critical hit*, frames, 01, frames,
06*, frames, 0D*, terminator

Magic attacks:
03*, 07*, frames, 05*, frames, 01, frame, 06*, frames, 0D*, terminator

Dodging animations:
02*, Dodging frames, 0E*, frame(s) for being out of the way, 01*, return to standing frame, 0D*,
terminator

Standing animations:
Standing frame*, 01*, terminator

Dodged attack:
03*, 07*, standing frame, frames, 04*, frames, 01, frames, 06*, frames, 0D*, terminator

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Important note about attack animations:

If more than one hit is used and the second hit doesn't land before the target's health depletes,
it will stick the game's health handling routine into a permanent state of raising the target's
HP, causing the game to freeze if the target counter attacks to queue another HP decrease.
It is recommended command 0x51 (81) be used as a short white flash signifying a hit, rather
than an actual hit, when multiple hits are desired.

s;Hayden;Oh, Tana... I'm grateful to see that you're safe and home again!|You've no idea how I worried when I heard you were under attack at Border Mulan.|You are not to leave again without my permission.|Do you understand?
s;Tana;Don't be mad, Father.|Look, I come bearing good news.|Eirika! Come out now!
u;Eirika;MidRight
s;Eirika;King Hayden, I am pleased to see you again, even in these sad times.
s;Hayden;Ah, Eirika! It does my heart good to see you safe.
s;Eirika;Thank you. I was able to escape the castle before Renais fell.|But I'm not sure if my father...
s;Hayden;Yes. I... have received word of your father.
s;Eirika;Your Highness?|Please tell me. Is my father well?
s;Hayden;...My friend King Fado...did not survive the fall of Renais Castle.
s;Eirika;...No, it cannot be...

u;Seth;FarRight
s;Seth;...
s;Hayden;Rest assured, Grado will be punished for its cowardly act.|This is Frelia's promise.|Eirika, please stay here and rest.|I cannot imagine how exhausted you must be.
s;Eirika;...
s;Seth;King Hayden. You know of Prince Ephraim's disappearance, do you not?
s;Hayden;Yes, we hear the prince and his men hound Grado at every turn.|It's said that he's led his forces in the empire itself.|Reports suggest he's crossed the border and now fights in Renvall.
s;Eirika;My brother... He fights on? Even now?
s;Hayden;Yes. My pegasus knights bought this information at a great price.|Even though Renais has fallen, he charges into the enemy's heart.|He is truly Fado's son... What a valiant youth.|I wish I knew whether he remains unharmed, but I do not.
s;Eirika;King Hayden, I thank you for your offer, but I cannot stay.|I intend to ride to my brother's side with reinforcements.
s;Hayden;I cannot allow it. I know how you feel, but this plan is suicide.|I would be betraying Fado's memory if I allowed any harm to befall you.|Stay here. Rest and mourn. Leave this war to the warriors.
s;Eirika;I know you mean well, Your Majesty.|However, I have lost my father, and my twin brother is in peril.|My brother, he is a part of me... I cannot rest here in peace while he risks his life.
s;Hayden;No. Renais has no more army. Grado's forces decimated it.|I wish Frelia could provide you with support, with soldiers, but...|My son, Innes, is on his way to meet the empire's forces. We cannot spare a single brigade.|Your own retinue of knights cannot possibly face Grado alone. Are you so determined to go?
s;Eirika;Yes. ...With apologies
s;Hayden;...As resolute as your father, eh? What am I to do in the face of such foolhardy determination?{w}{clear}Vanessa.

s;Tana;Eirika, you don't really intend to go through with this, do you?|I can't guess how you must feel, but it's just too dangerous.|What would happen if you were captured by Grado's men?
s;Eirika;Thank you for your concern, Tana. But I have no choice.|Don't you see, Tana? I have to go.
s;Tana;Eirika... Oh, why is this happening? What's gone wrong with the world?
s;Eirika;Tana...
s;Tana;Why would Grado invade?|Emperor Vigarde is a man of peace. His people adore him.|And you and Ephraim are friends with Prince Lyon, are you not?|What could be behind this madness? Why is this happening...
s;Eirika;I have no answers for you, Tana.|I don't want to believe it, but the reality is that we are at war.|If I do nothing, I may lose my brother as well as my father.|This is why I have to fight. It's the only answer I have.

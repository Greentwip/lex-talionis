s;Fado;Me? I shall remain here.|We have long held Grado among our dearest allies, yet now, they attack?|I must know why.
s;Fado;Am I somehow responsible for this? Have I erred in my leadership?|Renais is mine to guide... How could I have failed her so?

s;Eirika;Don't be foolish, Seth.|If it weren't for you, I would never have made it out of the castle.|You are the reason I'm still alive. You have my gratitude.

s;Eirika;And whoever that man was, he was clearly after me...|It's my fault that you received such a grave wound.|Allow me to treat it, I--
s;Seth;Your Highness, I can't allow an injury like this to be an obstacle.|We have more important matters to attend to. We must press on to Frelia.|We must fulfill his His Majesty's wishes.
s;Eirika;...|I wonder how my father fares alone in the castle. Do you think he's safe?|And what of my brother on the Grado front? We've heard nothing from him for days.
s;Seth;King Fado and Prince Ephraim are both valiant and brave men.|I doubt even the might of the Grado Empire can hold them in check.|More important to me, Your Highness, is that you look to your own safety.|How sad the two of them would be if something were to happen to you.|We must reach Frelia to ensure the day of your happy reunion.
s;Eirika;Yes, of course. You're right.|Until I'm reunited with my father and brother, I must not despair.|Come, Seth. Let us go.

-- KNOWN ISSUES:
- Music may not work on or even crash Mac's with El Capitan update (AudioComponent.h error in El Capitan mac)
- Avast Antivirus or other antiviruses may slow down certain actions that write to disk. Known issue with Avast Antivirus Behaviour Shield and exiting the game.
- Need to compile cython modules for Linux/Mac

-- MISSING ANIMS:
- Demon Surge (Disintegrate)
- Evil Eye (Scathe)
- Shadowshot (Hex)
- Restore (Restore)

- Add support to fe_repo_to_lex for Dragonstone

Add separate combine action to convoy (for turnwheel branch)
Casual death? Check other_game (- Check that casual doesn't have a death cooldown)

- Turnwheel
    - Make it pretty and work the way FE Echoes works
    - If loading crashed save, allow execution of turnwheel forward
    - Add turnwheel finalize script
    - Check that max turnwheel, turnwheel count etc works
- Submaps
- Overworld
- Parties (maybe just convoy differentiation -- since Anchorman has managed different parties pretty well themselves)
- Add "having 2+ parties" ability to the Engine and Wiki.
- Test player phase and enemy phase battle animation music

*** Check that this fix happened ***
- Fix Intersection between items, statuses, turnwheel actions, and saving/loading the game
- When you give a unit an item that gives a status. You will have
    - Give Item Action
    - Give Status Actions
- Run it backwards and the status will be removed twice... Hmmm..
- Maybe need to MAKE SURE ALL ACTIONS NEVER CALL ANOTHER ACTION
************************************

- New Screenshots in all marketing content
- When I fix events, make escape, seize, switch, search, etc, all work the same way
- Split up gaining exp, gaining level, and promoting into separate routines that use the Action system
- Add filtering class wexp -- so you could do reclassing?

- Test Current Party to Properties of Level Editor
- Test LEVEL EDITOR!

- Check that you can skip over overworld sections without repercussions
    - Or disallow skipping over overworld...
=== These go together -- before animation special effects ===
- Implement legendary animation
- Implement Devil axe effect --  -- gotta think about this...
- Add Lethality, Pavise, Sure Strike, and Pierce -- maybe Devil Axe also?
=============================================================
- Test stationary weapon event tiles + saving + turnwheel
- Add Fog of War
- Test removing a stat from stat list (InfoMenu, UnitMenu, Combat)

To Test Action:
WarpIn
LeaveMap
Fully Test RecordRandomState
ApplyStatus
RemoveStatus
FinalizeActiveSkill
FinalizeAutomaticSkill
-- These need to be tested on load as well
ChangeTileSprite
ReplaceTiles
AreaReplaceTiles
LayerTileSprite
LayerTerrain
ShowLayer
HideLayer
ClearLayer
AddTileProperty
RemoveTileProperty
AddWeather
RemoveWeather

Upon activation of turnwheel:
Music Fades
Gong sounds mean turnwheel has been activated
Display translates in
Turn 1 in upper right
2 lines of text through top banner
Num turnwheel uses in bottom right
Units left to move in bottomleft (Left:    19/20)
Small bright border around top and bottom and black outer fade

When the turnwheel is moved forward or backwards in time, clicking sound is emitted
"Start of Player Phase" (hovers over Lord Character)
"(nothing at all)" (hovers over Delthea -- who I moved first)
"Delthea attacked Gargoyle"/"Prevailed over Gargoyle"

When turnwheel is actived -- crazy green animation occurs
Loud sound like crashing water + magic is emitted
While crazy green animation occurs, turnwheel fades out

"Catria activated Defensive"
When you move without attacking, no text is displayed
"Delthea attacked Gargoyle" with nothing else if Delthea does not defeat Gargoyle

So each movement gets two turnwheel clicks, one for before they've taken their turn, and one for after they've taken their turn. During both of these cursor is hovered over unit in question.

Cannot activate turnwheel on enemy turn
"Start of enemy phase"

"Start of player phase" can't actually be chosen by turnwheel!

does movement, killing units, attacking in turnwheel have an animation?

--- EXTRA ---
=============

- Add Decals and Colors to Info Menus... ??** -- Update Info Menu to match Sacred Stones?

- Add levelup quotes - optional - Because characters don't really matter for this game, probably not
- Add Turnwheel
- Add Awakening-style dialogue backlog...??** On R press
- Have Music Crossfade? -- Not possible with Pygame (SDL_mixer)! only one streamed music channel at a time :(
- Add other numbers to Level Up Numbers (5 - 7)

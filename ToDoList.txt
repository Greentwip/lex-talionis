-- KNOWN ISSUES:
- Music may not work on or even crash Mac's with El Capitan update (AudioComponent.h error in El Capitan mac)
- Avast Antivirus or other antiviruses may slow down certain actions that write to disk. Known issue with Avast Antivirus Behaviour Shield and exiting the game.
- Need to compile cython modules for Linux/Mac

-- MISSING ANIMS:
- Demon Surge (Disintegrate)
- Evil Eye (Scathe)
- Shadowshot (Hex)
- Restore (Restore)

v0.9.1
- Palette Editor
    - Build Palette Editor

v0.9.3 -- combat update & activated status update
- Arena
    - Seems to believe p2 is the attacker sometimes in solver, but not in UI

v0.9.4 -- dialogue and command update
- Dialogue Editor
- Split dialogue and commands into 2 separate files
- Really, just totally rewrite how dialogue works
- Rapidly tapping A on Dialogue sometimes causes it to jitter up and down while leaving (probably just need to rewrite how dialogue is rendered to the screen anyway...)
- When I fix events, make visit, escape?, seize, switch, search, etc, all work the same way
- Instead of current system, use system of triggers which trigger events. Then can simply attach events to items and statuses and that becomes very easy

v0.9.5 -- menu update
- Fix menus
- Take in Mouse input as well

v0.9.6 -- overworld & submap update
- Test overworld
- Check that you can skip over overworld sections without repercussions
    - Or disallow skipping over overworld...
- Test submap

Later on:
- Test stationary weapon event tiles + saving + turnwheel
- Add Fog of War
- Test removing a stat from stat list (InfoMenu, UnitMenu, Combat)
- Jealousy System??
- New Game + ? (difficulty modes only accessible after beating a difficulty?)
- Automatic Updater
- Add AI taking into account nearby allies/enemies?

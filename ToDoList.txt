-- KNOWN ISSUES:
- Music may not work on or even crash Mac's with El Capitan update (AudioComponent.h error in El Capitan mac)
- Avast Antivirus or other antiviruses may slow down certain actions that write to disk. Known issue with Avast Antivirus Behaviour Shield and exiting the game.
- Need to compile cython modules for Linux/Mac

-- MISSING ANIMS:
- Demon Surge (Disintegrate)
- Evil Eye (Scathe)
- Shadowshot (Hex)
- Restore (Restore)

- Turnwheel
    - Make it pretty and work the way FE Echoes works
    - If loading crashed save, allow execution of turnwheel forward
- Submaps
- Overworld
- Parties (maybe just convoy differentiation -- since Anchorman has managed different parties pretty well themselves)
- Check that casual doesn't have a death cooldown.
- Check that HP/minis shows up after NOT using formation?
- Add "having 2+ parties" ability to the Engine and Wiki.

- New Screenshots in all marketing content

Upon activation of turnwheel:
Music Fades
Gong sounds mean turnwheel has been activated
Display translates in
Turn 1 in upper right
2 lines of text through top banner
Num turnwheel uses in bottom right
Units left to move in bottomleft (Left:    19/20)
Small bright border around top and bottom and black outer fade

When the turnwheel is moved forward or backwards in time, clicking sound is emitted
"Start of Player Phase" (hovers over Lord Character)
"(nothing at all)" (hovers over Delthea -- who I moved first)
"Delthea attacked Gargoyle"/"Prevailed over Gargoyle"

When turnwheel is actived -- crazy green animation occurs
Loud sound like crashing water + magic is emitted
While crazy green animation occurs, turnwheel fades out

"Catria activated Defensive"
When you move without attacking, no text is displayed
"Delthea attacked Gargoyle" with nothing else if Delthea does not defeat Gargoyle

So each movement gets two turnwheel clicks, one for before they've taken their turn, and one for after they've taken their turn. During both of these cursor is hovered over unit in question.

Cannot activate turnwheel on enemy turn
"Start of enemy phase"

"Start of player phase" can't actually be chosen by turnwheel!

does movement, killing units, attacking in turnwheel have an animation?

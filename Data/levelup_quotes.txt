Ophie;This must be the work of Vagnius!!!;I've still got a lot more to learn.;The power of justice flows through me! Now nothing can stand in my way.;Master Yohn's teachings... I finally understand.;I suppose I must find a new teacher.;My class may have changed, but my goal remains the same.
Joel;Hmmph. Today's not my best day;A great start!;I feel right at home!;Nobody need worry anymore, Joel is here!;Is it finally time to rest?

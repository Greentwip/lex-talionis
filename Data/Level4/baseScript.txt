	s;Sam;No, boy.{w}{br}Do you have faith in the Resistance?{w}{br}Do you believe that we can succeed?{w}{br}That we can cleanse these Imperial scum from our land?{w};auto
	s;Ophie;What?{w}{br}Where's this coming from?{w};auto
	s;Sam;I was made aware of your outburst yesterday...{w}{br}So I'll ask again.{w}{br}Do you have faith?{w};auto
	s;Ophie;...No.{w}{br}I guess I don't have faith in your Resistance...{w}{br}But I want to see the Empire crushed, same as you!{w}{br}I lost my home to the Empire!{w}{br}Why else would I even be here?{w};auto

	s;Ophie;Well yeah...{w};auto
	s;Sam;Then we understand one another?{w};auto
	s;Ophie;Yeah.{w}{br}But if I'm going to follow your orders, I need to know...{w}{br}Who are your sources?{w}{br}And why don't you fight with us?{w};auto
	s;Sam;...I can't answer those questions yet.{w};auto
	s;Ophie;Of course...{w};auto

	s;Sam;I know how it feels to lose everything to the Empire.{w}{br}Even now, the memories still burn a hole in my gut.{w}{br}So I know what you're going through...{w}{br}But if you can trust me, I promise we will have our revenge.{w};auto

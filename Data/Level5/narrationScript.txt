s;Nia;Err... B-bad sneak here!{w};auto
s;Sam;A spy?{w};auto
s;Woman2;Mrghghgl!{w};auto
s;Sam;If the Empire's discovered our location...{w}{br}We need to leave right away...{w}{br}I wasn't expecting them to be able to track this--{w};auto

s;Woman2;No! I'm not a spy!{w};auto

# Nia moves back
move_sprite;Nia;-24,0
s;Sam;So you say you're no spy...{w}{br}Why are you here then?{w};auto
s;Woman2;I was just trying to speak to you.{w}{br}We need your help!{w};auto
s;Sam;We?{w};auto
s;Woman2;I'm from Podoma.{w}{br}Your group defended our village.{w};auto
r;Nia
s;Sam;Go on...{w};auto
s;Woman2;Because of the drought, our last harvest was poor.{w}{br}W-we couldn't pay the Empire's absurd taxes.{w}{br}So they sent one of their warlocks...{w};auto
u;Ophie;MidRight
s;Ophie;Vagnius!{w};auto
s;Woman2;He took the only thing we had left...{w}{br}our children...{w}{br}Please, you have to help us!{w}{br}I can't bear to lose my son!{w};auto
u;Althea;FarLeft
s;Althea;Even for the Empire, stealing children seems excessive.{w};auto
u;Ophie;MidRight
s;Ophie;It must be Vagnius's idea!{w}{br}That bastard!{w}{br}Where did he take them?{w};auto
s;Woman2;H-he said he was taking them to the Sun temple's ruins...{w};auto
s;Sam;A likely story...{w}{br}They must be trying to draw us out.{w}{br}Well, we won't give them the satisfaction.{w}{br}Sorry, but we're not just going to walk right into their trap.{w};auto
r;Ophie;Althea
u;Ophie;FarLeft
s;Ophie;How can you be so heartless?{w};auto
s;Sam;I'm just being rational.{w}{br}Let's take some time and think this through.{w}{br}We'll find a plan that doesn't require blindly walking into Vagnius's trap.{w};auto
s;Ophie;We can't just sit here and do nothing!{w}{br}We're the Resistance, and we do what's right!{w};auto
u;Joel;MidRight
s;Joel;Well said, lad.{w};auto
s;Sam;Joel!{w};auto
s;Joel;Sorry, captain, but the lad's right...{w}{br}If we can't stop Imperials from snatching children out from under our noses,{w}{br}we don't deserve to be called the Resistance.{w};auto
s;Sam;Harrumph...{w}{br}It's your life to throw away...{w};auto
r;Sam
s;Joel;I reckon' we don't got time to dawdle.{w}{br}Let's go while the trail's fresh!{w};auto
s;Ophie;Right!{w};auto

# Ophie, Sam, Althea meet with Kiley outside the city
s;Kiley;Aye, the announcement came just in time.{w}{br}We were weathering their assault,{w}{br}but they were threat'ning to push us out of the city...{w};auto
s;Sam;And then?{w};auto
s;Kiley;I'd never seen anything like it.{w}{br}With Ulver's death, I felt a wicked spasm go through me.{w}{br}I guess everyone did.{w};auto
s;Kiley;It was a human tide--{w}{br}The Keralans picked up their hatchets and pikes and took to the streets.{w}{br}There was a bit of butchery for a moment,{w}{br}but then the remaining soldiers surrendered.{w}{br}Hah! Even Imperials know how to save their own skins.{w};auto

s;Sam;Erm... Perhaps,{w}{br}but there's still so much work to be done.{w}{br}We need to get you on the throne.{w}{br}The Confederacy needs to formally recognize our independence.{w}{br}The Keralan border towns still need to be liberated...{w};auto
s;Althea;The Empire is not going to take this lying down.{w};auto
s;Kiley;Aye, lass.{w}{br}But that's what you have me and my boys for.{w}{br}We ain't gonna let any dirty Imperials just walk in here like last time.{w};auto
s;Althea;Sam, you're right.{w}{br}There's still so much work to do.{w}{br}But we can do this.{w}{br}With you all at my back, we'll rebuild Kerala into what it once was.{w};auto

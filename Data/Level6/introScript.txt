s;Kayla;Before we make our way in, a heads-up.{w}{br}The Confederacy has a man on the inside, posing as a prisoner.{w}{br}He goes by the code name 'Coyote'.{w}{br}But we lost contact with him.{w}{br}They must've have tightened up security.{w}{br}Honestly, he's probably dead.{w};auto 
s;Kayla;But if he's still around, he could be a valuable resource.{w};auto
s;Sam;We'll keep that in mind.{w}{clear}Our objective is to incapacitate the warden.{w}{br}If we can take out their chain of command, gaining control over the prison should follow.{w}{br}But on the way, we need to free as many prisoners as possible, in case we fail.{w};auto

s;Sam;So then...{w}{br}Our last few missions have been quite... challenging.{w};auto
s;Joel;You're tellin' me...{w};auto
s;Sam;Hopefully this next one will be easier.{w};auto

u;Ophie;MidLeft
s;Ophie;We know who your sources are, Sam.{w}{br}She's standing right here.{w};auto
s;Kayla;Tsk tsk. No need to ruin Sam's fun, Ophie.{w}{br}You know playing at spymaster is the only thing he has left--{w};auto
s;Sam;Ahem.{w}{br}As I was saying, my sources, that is, the Confederacy,{w}{br}determined the location of Duke Ulver's upcoming military plans.{w}{br}Details of Imperial logistics would be an invaluable asset.{w};auto
s;Ophie;Why can't the Confederacy do their own work for once?{w}{br}We didn't ask to be at their beck and call.{w};auto
s;Sam;Well, this information has value for both parties.{w}{clear}Plus, the Confederacy has been so far unsuccessful using stealth.{w}{br}So... we're going to capture the plans by force!{w};auto
s;Ophie;Of course...{w};auto
s;Sam;We believe they are currently at Fort Bekal, which is nearby.{w}{br}We'll leave after breakfast.{w}{br}Hopefully the plans will be in hand by lunch.

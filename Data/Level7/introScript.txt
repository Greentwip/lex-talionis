u;Kayla;Right
s;Sam;Hmmm.... There's a lot of them.{w}{br}Duke Ulver has this place locked down.{w};auto
s;Kayla;And look who's leading them!{w};auto
s;Sam;Huh?{w};auto
s;Kayla;See that black banner flying above the fort?{w};auto
s;Sam;I don't recognize it...{w};auto
s;Kayla;Tsk Tsk.{w}{br}It's the flag of the elite Imperial tacticians.{w}{br}This wasn't in the report. We'd better be on our guard.{w};auto
s;Sam;Strange to see someone of that caliber posted to simple guard duty.{w};auto
s;Kayla;All the more reason to get that information.{w};auto
s;Sam;I just hope its worth the effort.{w};auto
s;Kayla;Oh, it will be. Trust me.{w};auto

u;Marduk;Left;u;Vagnius;Right
s;Vagnius;I can trust you then?{w};auto
s;Marduk;Of course, milord. My plans have never failed!{w}{br}Once the Resistance attacks, well, they're surely going to regret it!{w};auto
s;Vagnius;Good, good. I want them wiped out.{w}{br}No captives. No survivors.{w};auto
s;Marduk;It's all been factored into the plan.{w}{br}Which is flawless, by the way.{w}{br}As long as they show up, of course.{w};auto
s;Vagnius;Oh, they'll show alright.{w}{br}We have a mole in the Confederacy.{w}{br}We fed them false information that this fort was basically unguarded.{w};auto
s;Marduk;Ah, but of course, it's not poorly guarded at all!{w}{br}Genius, milord. I couldn't have come up with a better plan myself.{w};auto
s;Vagnius;Perhaps that is why they kicked you out here to the colonies.{w};auto
s;Marduk;Milord?{w};auto
s;Vagnius;Nothing, nothing.{w}{br}I'll trust you to see this through.{w};auto
r;Vagnius
s;Marduk;Good day, milord.{w};auto 
r;Marduk
u;Marduk;Right
s;Marduk;How dare he, insult my genius...{w}{br}I'll show him.{w}{br}I'll kill two Resistances!{w}{br}See how he likes that!{w}{br}Yeah...{w};auto

s;Theo;Yes...?{w};auto
s;Prim;You know a lot about the Empire.{w};auto
s;Theo;Uh... well... I don't know if that's true.{w}{br}There's always more to learn.{w};auto
s;Prim;Well, do you know who that man was?{w};auto
s;Theo;He definitely didn't seem like one of the Duke's normal lieutenants.{w}{br}That ward he used signified that much.{w}{br}I would guess he was sent here on the Empress's orders.{w}{br}Whatever's in this information must be important...{w};auto

s;Vagnius;How noble of you to grace me with your--{w};auto
s;Ulver;Vagnius.{w}{br}Spare me your ingratiations.{w}{br}What of the Resistance?{w};auto
s;Vagnius;Marduk... has failed, milord.{w}{br}The Resistance lives.{w};auto
s;Ulver;Hmmph!{w};auto
s;Vagnius;But we were close this time, milord. So very, very close!{w}{br}Give me one more chance.{w};auto
s;Ulver;Hmmm... Second chances are not the Imperial way.{w}{br}Nor a taste for failure.
s;Vagnius;Milord?
s;Ulver;...{w}{br}What is your plan this time?{w};auto
s;Vagnius;The village of Podoma, milord.{w}{br}The Resistance will not ignore the feverish pleas of their own countrymen.{w}{br}I can draw them into the open and eliminate them once and for all.{w};auto
s;Ulver;How... ignoble.{w};auto
s;Vagnius;Milord?{w};auto
s;Ulver;Proceed with your plan, Vagnius.{w}{br}This is your last chance.{w};auto

s;Adjutant;Milord?{w};auto
s;Ulver;''To the strongest.''{w}{br}Is this not the way of the Empire, Adjutant?{w};auto

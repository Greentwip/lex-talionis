	s;Coyote;I am aware.{w};auto
	s;Sam;Okay then...
	s;Coyote;Rumor has it you're planning to assault Rajas.
	s;Sam;Hmmm... It's a complicated problem.{w}{br}Ulver has at least five hundred men stationed--{w}{clear}Wait. Back up. How'd did you find out?
	s;Coyote;It doesn't matter.{w}{clear}Are you aware of the Order of the Templars?
	s;Sam;Of course I'm aware.{w}{br}What do you take me for?{w}{br}I've looked into them myself, but they're a myth, nothing more.
	s;Coyote;They're no myth.
	s;Sam;You've met them?
	s;Coyote;I have.
	s;Sam;Pah...{w}{br}The Templars were said to be the Solarch's most loyal protectors.{w}{br}They were to defend the throne with their lives.{w}{br}To snuff out dissent, they could appear anywhere in Rajas, at any time...{w}{br}...{w}{br}Are you suggesting--
	s;Coyote;Tunnels. Under the city.
	s;Sam;You expect me to believe--
	s;Coyote;It's the only way in.
	s;Sam;...*sigh*{w}{br}If we can find one of these tunnels...

	s;Althea;It's nothing...
	s;Prim;I noticed you were... hesitant at the meeting today.{w}{br}Is something wrong?
	s;Althea;No, nothing's wrong...
	s;Prim;You know, Althea, you can talk to me.{w}{br}I won't tell anyone else if something's bothering you.
	s;Althea;*sniff*... 
	s;Prim;...Do you not want to be queen?
	s;Althea;It's... It's not that I don't want to...{w}{br}Ah... I j-just can't...
	s;Prim;What? Why couldn't you?{w}{br}You're the spitting image of your mother--
	s;Althea;It's not that I can't be queen...{w}{br}I just won't be able to.{w}{br}I have no experience...{w}{br}My sister was the expected heir to the throne.{w}{br}She was the one everyone looked up to...{w}{br}She was so strong. I am but a shadow in comparison...
	s;Prim;That doesn't matter, Althea--
	s;Althea;It does! I'm... I'm too weak.{w}{br}Everyone will be relying on me.{w}{br}What if I fail? I-It's too much! 
	move_sprite;Prim;-48,0
	s;Prim;There there.{w}{br}Slow down... you'll make yourself hysterical.
	s;Althea;See I'm just weak...{w}{br}I have nothing of the royal strength in me.
	s;Prim;That's untrue, Althea. You do have the makings of a queen.{w}{br}I may not know much about politics or government,{w}{br}but I have a knack for knowing a good person when I see one.{w}{br}And I know that you do not lack strength.
	s;Althea;Y-you really think so?
	s;Prim;I believe in you.{w}{br}Also, there's something else you haven't thought of.
	s;Althea;Hmmm...?
	s;Prim;You won't be taking on the responsibility of the throne alone.{w}{br}Do you think we'll just abandon you?{w}{br}Our job will not be over when Kerala is freed.

	s;Drake;My lady Althea... Your conduct at the meeting was concerning--{w}{br}Wait, you've been crying?{w}{br}I would not normally strike a lady, Prim, but you leave me no choice--
	s;Althea;Haha... Drake, hold!
	s;Drake;My lady?
	s;Althea;Yes, I've been crying, but it's nothing to be concerned with.{w}{br}Prim and I were just talking. She was very helpful.
	s;Drake;Oh, is that all.{w}{br}My poor heart...
	s;Althea;There's nothing to be worried about, Drake.{w}{br}I'll be queen.{w}{br}Well, I'll try my best at it.{w}{br}You'll be there for me, right?
	s;Drake;Of course, my lady...{w}{br}If you so wished it I would never leave your side!
	s;Prim;See, Althea. You won't have to shoulder this burden alone.{w}{br}Although you may wish you had after a couple of weeks.

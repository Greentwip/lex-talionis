    s;Sam;I see...
    s;Kayla;Is something wrong, dearest?
    s;Sam;No... Well, its nothing you said.
    s;Kayla;So?
    s;Sam;This is our last mission...
    s;Kayla;You worry we won't succeed?
    s;Sam;To be honest, I am a bit worried. Even you have your limits, Kayla. 
    s;Kayla;Haven't found them yet!
    s;Sam;Anyways, thats not really my chief concern.{w}{br}It's our last mission together.{w}{br}When this is over we'll split ways.{w}{br}The Resistance will be disbanded.{w}{br}So, there won't be much of a reason... for the two of us.
    s;Kayla;Sam, say no more. You know my feelings toward you.{w}{br}Do you think I'll just leave?
    s;Sam;No, but we each have jobs, responsibilities, ambitions.{w}{br}Those too can strand us apart.{w}{br}I don't want to look back on today with any regrets. 
    s;Kayla;Nor do I.
    s;Sam;Well, then,{w}{br}after this is over... if we're both still...{w}{br}around.{w}{br}I'd like to make this fling official.

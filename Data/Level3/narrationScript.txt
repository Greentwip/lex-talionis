s;Sam;Good morning everyone.{w};auto
s;Sam;As you all can see, we have some new members.{w}{br}I foresee good fortune in our future.{w}{br}Now, we'll be able to take the fight to the Imperial interlopers!{w};auto
s;Joel;Yeah, yeah, Sam.{w}{br}You give us the same prep talk before every mission.{w}{br}Just tell it to us straight.{w};auto
s;Sam;Fine. Theo has informed me that we're running low on funds.{w}{br}We need money for repairs, new armor, and so on.{w}{br}So...{w} we're gonna rob the Imperial Bank.{w};auto

s;Drake;Rob a bank? We'll be regarded as nothing more than common thugs.{w}{br}What honor can be found in that?{w};auto
s;Sam;This is no ordinary bank.{w}{br}The Empire imposes harsh taxes on the Keralan people.{w}{br}Their blood money is kept in Fort Kosheen before being sent to the Empire proper.{w}{br}We'll be... liberating this unearned revenue from the Empire.{w}{br}Surely you can see the honor in that, Drake?{w};auto
s;Drake;Hmmm...{w};auto

u;Ophie;MidLeft
s;Ophie;But won't this fort be heavily guarded?{w};auto
s;Sam;Normally, yes.{w}{br}But my sources assure me that the guard at Fort Kosheen will be light tonight.{w}{br}They will be having other... troubles.{w}{br}Leaving the treasure for us.{w};auto

s;Prim;Uh... Yeah!{w};auto
s;Joel;Well, then, sounds like a plan.{w}{br}I'm fixin' to get me some breakfast.{w}{br}Who's with me?{w};auto

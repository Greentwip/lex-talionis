s;Joel;Well... we're here.{w};auto
s;Ophie;This is the Resistance base?! But it's so... small.{w};auto
s;Joel;It is rather cozy, ain't it?{w}{clear}Anyway, let's talk to Sam.{w}{br}He'll know what to do with the lot of you.{w};auto
s;Prim;Sam?{w};auto
s;Joel;Our tactician. The brains behind this whole operation.{w}{clear}Now, I must warn ya'll.{w}{br}Not every one o' my esteemed colleagues is as friendly,{w} handsome,{w} and good-natured as I.{w};auto 
s;Ophie;Uh huh.{w};auto
s;Joel;It's a hard life in the Resistance.{w}{br}Just look at Nia.{w}{br}Nia?{w}{br}Damnation. She disappeared again.{w};auto
s;Prim;Nia doesn't talk much, does she?{w};auto
s;Joel;Nope. But I talk enough for the both of us.{w}{br}Besides, the lass has other ways of getting her point across...{w}{br}as ya'll almost found out.{w};auto

s;Sam;Hmmph. You're barely more than children.{w}{br}What use are you to the Resistance?{w};auto
s;Ophie;I can fight!{w}{br}You will not find my blade lacking!{w};auto
s;Prim;Also, I am trained in the healing arts...{w};auto

r;Joel
u;Drake;FarLeft

s;Althea;So... can they join your Resistance?{w};auto
s;Sam;What?{w}{br}Oh... of course.{w}{br}Sorry, your highness. It's just surprising news.{w}{br}This changes everything. All my plans...{w}{br}But I'm getting ahead of myself...{w}{br}Your highness, please take a seat.{w};auto
s;Althea;Call me Althea.{w};auto
s;Sam;Althea, then. We have a lot to discuss...{w};auto

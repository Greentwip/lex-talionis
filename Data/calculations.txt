# Legal nonnumeric values:
# HP, STR, MAG, SKL, SPD, LCK, DEF, RES, CON
# AS (attackspeed), DIST (distance), ITEM_WEIGHT
# ITEM_HIT, ITEM_MT, ITEM_CRIT
# Must set up equations that calculate HIT, AVOID, STAFF_HIT, STAFF_AVOID, CRIT, CRIT_AVOID, AS, DAMAGE, MAGIC_DAMAGE, DEFENSE, MAGIC_DEFENSE
AS = SPD - ITEM_WEIGHT
HIT = ITEM_HIT + SKL*2 + LCK/2
AVOID = AS*2 + LCK
STAFF_HIT = ITEM_HIT + MAG*5 + SKL
STAFF_AVOID = RES*5 + DIST*2
CRIT = ITEM_CRIT + SKL/2
CRIT_AVOID = LCK
DAMAGE = STR
DEFENSE = DEF
MAGIC_DAMAGE = MAG
MAGIC_DEFENSE = RES

# UnitLevel.txt is used to define what units will be part of this level and where they will spawn
# 
# Each unit belongs on its own line
# Syntax:
# New Units:
# team; 0; event_id; class; level; items; position; ai; faction; status (optional)
# - OR -
# Saved units:
# team; 1; event_id; unit_id; position; ai
# - OR -
# Created Units:
# team; 2; event_id; class; items; position; ai; faction; status (optional)

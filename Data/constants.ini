; Which column should units with fleet_of_foot use in mcost.txt (0-indexed)
fleet_mcost_column=7
; How linear the exp curve is. Zero is exactly linear. Higher = less linear (normal FE is around 0.035)
exp_curve=0.22

; Allow automatic promotion after max level?
auto_promote=1
; How to level up non-player units
; 0: Random - On level-up, growth rate chance to level the stat.
; 1: Fixed - Start each stat at 50. On level-up, add growth rate to stat. When over 100, decrement by 100 and level the stat once
; 2: Hybrid - On level-up, sum all growth rates together. Choose x of the stats to level-up randomly based on their probability, where x = summed growth rates/100
; 3: Match - Match whatever the player chose

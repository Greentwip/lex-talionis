    s;Franz;Sir Gilliam, is that Mulan? Have we reached Frelia's border already?
    s;Gilliam;Aye, we have. Her Highness Princess Tana should be inside the castle.
    s;Franz;But look--the countryside is crawling with Grado soldiers!{w}{br}Where's the castle guard? Has Mulan fallen? Are we too late?
    s;Gilliam;Too tough to say from here.{w}{br}Princess Tana's in no danger if they want her as a bargaining tool.{w}{br}We men of the Eastern Watch will see her to safety.
    s;Franz;Yes... Yes, of course.{br}We mustn't give up. We must move.{w}{br}We must retake the castle. Then, we ride forth to Princess Eirika's aid.
    s;Gilliam;I've stronger armor than you do. I'll take the lead. Watch my back.

s;Eirika;But we can't just ignore this...{w}{br}You were there when Renais was invaded... You saw what I saw.{w}{br}You saw how the people suffered at the hands of Grado's soldiers.{w}{br}Homes were destroyed, possessions stolen, women kidnapped...{w}{br}Anyone who resisted was executed without question, without hesitation.
s;Seth;...
s;Eirika;Please, Seth. I can't allow that to happen here.{w}{br}I don't want to see any more people harmed by Grado's atrocities.
s;Seth;All right, Princess. I understand. Perhaps we can retake Mulan.{w}{br}But, Princess, you must act with caution. Your people need you, too.

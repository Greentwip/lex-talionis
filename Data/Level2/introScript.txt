s;Joel;The Resistance base is a little yonder.{w}{clear}Normally I'd stop at the village here for supplies,{w}{br}but I think gettin' ya'll to the base takes precedence.{w};auto
s;Prim;Don't burden yourself on our account.{w};auto
s;Joel;Its no burden, lass...{w};auto
s;Ophie;How come we've never heard of your Resistance before?{w}{br}The monks never spoke of an organized resistance.
s;Joel;Well, lad, it's complicated.
s;Ophie;We got time.
s;Prim;Ophie! Don't be so rude.
s;Ophie;Prim, if we're joining this Resistance, I want to know everything about it.{w}{br}We're goin' to be putting our lives on the line!
s;Joel;The lad's right, Prim. Ya'll deserve to know.{w}{br}Honestly, we ain't been so successful lately.{w}{br}We don't have the manpower to fight the Empire openly,{w}{br}and our latest missions have been turning up blanks.
s;Ophie;Hmmph.
s;Joel;But there's no cause for concern!{w}{br}Between ya'll and Sam's new allies, I reckon things are lookin' up!

u;Ophie;MidRight
s;Ophie;Don't you want to see what's up?{w};auto
s;Joel;That sounds... dangerous.{w}{br}I reckon we should do the smart thing and walk around the fighting.{w};auto
s;Ophie;Hmmph. I thought you were freedom fighters, not cowards.{w};auto
s;Joel;Lad, don't test me.{w};auto
s;Prim;Someone could be in trouble...{w};auto
